                Sunriver Nature Center & Observatory (SNCO) has served as a hub for environmental education and nature
                exploration since 1968. Community residents and visitors alike enjoy quiet walks through SNCO’s campus
                and around Lake Aspen, often taking in views of stunning landscapes, diverse wildlife, and the
                star-filled night sky. Commemorate special people in your life with a Gift in Tribute at Sunriver Nature
                Center & Observatory. Amidst eight acres of beautiful landscape along Lake Aspen, your gift will hold
                steadfast in a unique setting throughout the seasons.

                You can support and enrich SNCO’s eight-acre campus by creating a living tribute with the gift of a
                tree.
